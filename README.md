# Programming-Fundamentals--September-2016
The Programming Fundamentals course extends the up-to-date initial programming skills of the Programming Basics Program and introduces basic techniques and tools that build on the writing of simple programming constructs.  Along with programming techniques, the course develops algorithmic thinking and builds problem solving skills by working on hundreds of practical exercises. All exercise and homework tasks are evaluated in real time with the automated SoftUni Online Judge system. The training methodology is extremely practical. The material provided includes conceptual theory with numerous examples and a large number of tasks with increasing difficulty, which build on each other and detailed instructions are applied to them. Practical work in class, with the active help of lecturers and assistants (or at home for online students), represents over 70% of course activity.
